# Architecture

How the Tide compiler is built. This file is the concrete "how"; the *why*
behind the architectural commitments (D1, D6, D8, D10, D14, D15, D16, ...)
lives in [`docs/design-decisions.md`](design-decisions.md).

## 1. Compiler pipeline

```
.td source
    │
    ▼
  lexer        internal/lexer    — text -> tokens
    │
    ▼
  parser       internal/parser   — tokens -> AST
    │
    ▼
  AST          internal/ast      — typed syntax tree
    │
    ▼
  checker      internal/sema     — type checking, inference, exhaustiveness
    │
    ▼
  codegen      internal/codegen  — Tide AST -> Go source (+ //line directives)
    │
    ▼
  go build     (the Go toolchain) — Go IR -> native binary
```

The Tide compiler's job ends at emitting Go. The Go toolchain produces the
binary.

## 2. Go as the intermediate representation

Go is an IR (decision D1), with these consequences:

- Codegen is not constrained to produce idiomatic or readable Go.
- Sum types, exhaustive `match`, and non-nullable types are encoded for
  correctness — typically as sealed-interface families plus tag discrimination.
- Calling a bound Go function is just an emitted Go call: **zero** runtime FFI
  cost, no marshalling, no ABI boundary.

### Source maps — `//line` directives

`internal/codegen` emits `//line file:line` for every construct. The Go
compiler honors these, so runtime panics, stack traces, `runtime.Caller`, and
(via DWARF) `delve` stepping and `pprof` profiles all report `.td` locations.
Mandatory from Phase 1 (decision D8).

### The Go subset contract

Tide commits to a defined, stable subset of Go as its IR (decision D15). Codegen
emits only that conservative subset and never depends on experimental Go
features. Bindgen depends only on the stable `go/importer` / `go/types` API
(source-mode importing, keeping the toolchain dependency-free), never on
compiler internals. The exact subset and supported Go version range
are a backlog item to be pinned before codegen settles.

## 3. The binding subsystem — `internal/bindgen`

```
Go package
    │
    ▼
go/importer introspection    — load real types and signatures (source mode)
    │
    ▼
raw binding declarations     — mechanical, signature-faithful (D6)
    │
    ▼
idiomatic wrapper pass       — agent/human: (T,error)->Result, options, etc.
    │
    ▼
std/<package>.td             — generated, committed bindings
```

Raw signatures are derived from the Go type checker and never hand-written.
Only the wrapper layer involves judgment.

### Mapping rules (Go -> Tide)

| Go shape | Tide shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `func F() (T, error)` | `Result<T, error>` | the dominant error idiom |
| `func F() (T, bool)` | comma-ok form / `Option<T>` | distinct from the error case |
| `func F() *T` returning nil | `Option<T>` | nil-returning pointers are nullable |
| `func F() *T`, always non-nil¹ | `T` (direct) | wrapper-layer override; audited per binding |
| `func F() T`, T valid with error (e.g. `Read`) | tuple `(T, error)` kept | rare; do not collapse |
| `func F() (T, U)` (neither error nor bool) | tuple `(T, U)` | e.g. `context.WithTimeout` |
| `interface{}` / `any` | `Any` (escape type) | binding-only; concrete values widen at call site |
| `type D int64` (named) | nominal newtype | working shape `newtype D = int64` |
| variadic `...T` | variadic param `...T` | for `...any` → `...Any` |
| variadic `chan<- T` / `<-chan T` | `SendChan<T>` / `RecvChan<T>` | directional channel views |
| functional-options pattern | normal optional params | wrapper-layer work |

¹ The wrapper layer marks a returned `*T` as non-nullable when the Go
documentation or established usage guarantees a non-nil pointer
(`*http.Request.URL`, `*http.Request.Body`, `*http.Response.Header`,
...). The audited list is one of the L3 "this is where a wrapper made a
semantic decision" checkpoints; mismatches with reality become bugs and
are caught by differential testing.

The dangerous cases — nullability, `(T,error)` vs comma-ok vs both-valid,
panics — are *semantic*; signature derivation does not catch them. They are the
focus of behavioral testing (section 6).

### The FFI wall

Go packages enter Tide *only* through generated bindings (D4). They are not
first-class imports. This keeps Go's `nil` / pointer / `interface{}` /
`context` impedance at one explicit boundary.

## 4. Concurrency

Concurrency is uncolored (decision D7) — no `async`, no `await`.

- `spawn { ... }` — run a block concurrently (compiles to a goroutine).
- Channels — `makeChannel<T>()`, `.send(v)`, `.recv()`, typed `chan<T>`.
- `select` — wait on multiple channel operations.

The recommended surface is a **structured-concurrency scope**: tasks spawned in
a scope are joined when it ends; the first failure cancels its siblings. One
concept covers fan-out, error propagation, and cancellation, and maps onto Go
as `errgroup` + `context`. Cancellation derives from scope lifetime; explicit
`context` values from bound APIs interoperate at the binding boundary.
Generated concurrent code must pass `go test -race`.

## 5. Module system

Tide packages resolve with a decentralized, go-mod-style scheme (D5): import
path as URL, no central registry, MVS-style version selection, vendoring. Go
packages do not resolve this way — they enter only through bindings (D4).

## 6. Testing — the layered ladder

Cheapest checks first; do not spend expensive checks where cheap ones suffice.

- **L0 — impossible by construction.** Bindings generated from `go/importer`
  type info (D6): signature bugs eliminated, not tested.
- **L1 — round-trip compilation (free).** Every binding plus a use site is
  compiled Tide -> Go -> `go build`. Bad symbols are rejected by the Go
  compiler itself. Run across multiple Go versions to catch API drift.
- **L2 — structural diff against `go/types`.** Assert each binding is a
  faithful transform of the real signature under the mapping rules. Side
  effect: enumerates every place the wrapper made a semantic decision — an
  explicit audit list.
- **L3 — behavioral / differential testing.** Call the same Go function
  through the binding and directly, on fuzzed inputs, and diff. Fuzzing drives
  functions into nil/error branches where bugs live. For panics and nil: the
  agent predicts from the doc comment; a test confirms the prediction.
- **L4 — Go `Example*` functions as oracles.** Black-box, maintained,
  independent of Tide's generator. Convert these (not white-box unit tests)
  and check `// Output:`. Necessary but not sufficient: `Example*` functions
  cover documented, happy-path usage — error and nil branches are covered by
  L3, not L4. The two layers are complementary.
- **L5 — free static/dynamic oracles.** `go vet` on generated code;
  `go test -race` for concurrency.

Generated Go must always pass `go build`, `go vet`, and — for concurrent code —
`go test -race`. Compatibility scoring: anchor the denominator to Go's symbol
surface, tag depth (smoke / differential / fuzzed), score per
(package x category). The recurring failure mode is a test plan heavy on
"does it compile / type-check" and light on "does it *behave* identically" —
the dangerous binding bugs (wrong nullability, `(T, error)` vs comma-ok
confusion) pass compilation. Behavioural / differential testing on fuzzed
inputs is first-class, not an afterthought.
